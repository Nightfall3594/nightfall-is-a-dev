# A Personal Webpage

This is my personal website! Built to create a space where I could share my random thoughts :)

The design of this site is not mine, but rather an attempt at recreating a design that I found [elsewhere](https://github.com/mx-space), credits are due :) 

I really liked the design, and much more so when I found out it's free to host and deploy, but since the site is primarily written in chinese, I took it upon myself to fully rebuild an english version from scratch, with my own implementations for both the front and back end, primarily designed for personal use and sharing with my friends.
